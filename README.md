Hi there, I'm Chinmay Pimpalkhare🙌 and I'm a graduate student at Stanford, where I'm pursuing a Masters in Maths and Computing, with a Specialization in Data Science. I graduated from IIT Bombay in 2024 with a B.Tech (with Honours) in Mechanical Engineering and a Minor in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science.  I absolutely love learning new things and am highly motivated about exploring and researching various fields primarily in the realms of Artificial Intelligence, Safe Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Optimization and Robotics.
